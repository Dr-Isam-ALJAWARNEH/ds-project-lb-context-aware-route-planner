# Topic 2: location-based context-aware route planner

***Project Description***
Adapt Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm to perform route planning based on the pollution level in each street. The source of data is mobility data and fine-grained street-by-street level air quality data which contains, most importantly, data such as Particulate Matters (PM10 and PM2.5). This pollution data is considered as context that can be incorporated into the recommender system.
