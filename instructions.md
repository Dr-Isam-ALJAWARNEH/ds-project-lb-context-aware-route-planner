## some insights:
- Have a look at the Example: GMM for Generating New Data [Gaussian Mixture Models](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.12-gaussian-mixtures.html). AND
- Kernel Density Estimation [KDE](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.13-kernel-density-estimation.html)
- the data file contains granular (meter-meter level) low-cost air quality data, measuring most importantly Particulate Matters (PM10 and PM2.5), in addition to some other features including location represented as longitudes/latitudes!
